Enhance the existing full-stack web application to include a feature where users can test any REST API. The feature should allow users to input a REST API URL, fetch data from it, preview the response, and then enhance or create a new API endpoint based on the fetched data.

---

### **Frontend (React.js with Tailwind CSS)**:
1. Add a new section for **"Test REST API"** next to the existing prompt input field.
   - Include a button labeled "Test REST API" that opens a modal.
   - In the modal:
     - Provide an input field for the user to enter a REST API URL.
     - Include optional fields for HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), headers (key-value pairs), and body (for POST/PUT requests).
     - Add a "Test API" button to trigger the request.
   - Display the fetched response in JSON format within the modal.

2. Add an option to enhance or save the fetched data:
   - Include a "Create Endpoint" button that allows users to process the fetched data using OpenAI and store it as a new endpoint in Supabase.

3. Use Tailwind CSS for styling and React state management for handling modal visibility and form inputs.


---

### **Backend (Node.js with Express)**:
1. Create a new route `POST /test-api` to handle REST API testing:
   - Accept inputs such as:
     - The target REST API URL.
     - HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).
     - Headers (key-value pairs).
     - Body (for POST/PUT requests).
   - Use libraries like `axios` or `node-fetch` to make the request to the target REST API.
   - Return the fetched response back to the frontend.

2. Enhance the existing `POST /generate` route:
   - Allow users to pass fetched data from `POST /test-api` as input.
   - Process this data using OpenAI's GPT model for enhancement or transformation.
   - Store the enhanced JSON in Supabase under a new endpoint ID.

---

### **Supabase Integration**:
1. Extend the `endpoints` table schema to include metadata about REST API sources:
   - `source_api_url`: Text (optional; stores the original REST API URL if applicable).

2. Save enhanced data from tested APIs as new entries in Supabase.

---


4. User clicks "Create Endpoint," which sends this data to OpenAI for enhancement.
5. OpenAI processes and returns structured JSON (if needed), which is saved in Supabase under a unique endpoint ID.
6. A new dynamic API endpoint (e.g., `/api/67890`) is created for this enhanced data.

---

### **Additional Features**:
1. Allow users to edit headers and body content dynamically in the modal before testing APIs.
2. Add error handling for invalid URLs or failed requests.
3. Cache frequently tested APIs for faster responses using Redis or Supabase storage.

---

### **Deployment Instructions**:
1. Update both frontend and backend codebases with these changes.
2. Deploy updated backend routes (`/test-api`) using Vercel or Render.
3. Deploy updated frontend with modal functionality using Vercel or Netlify.

Use modern best practices for security, scalability, and performance optimization while implementing this feature.
